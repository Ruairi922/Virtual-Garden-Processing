# Virtual-Garden-Processing
 * This program allows users to create a virtual garden by selecting and placing flowers. It provides information about different flowers' environmental impact and helps users make eco-friendly choices.
I used the processing IDE to create a virtual garden application with an asthetic and vidually pleasing UI, and user friendly interaction.
Project was created as part of a solo First year computer science University project. It took roughly 3 months to create.
